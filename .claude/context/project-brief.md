# Project Brief

## What It Does
Bearing is a personal planning system that interlinks long-, medium-, and short-term planning through three views:
1. **OKR View** — Life Themes with nested Objectives and measurable Key Results
2. **Calendar View** — Yearly 12×31 grid for daily focus assignment to themes
3. **EisenKan View** — Kanban board with Eisenhower priority sorting for task execution

## Why It Exists
Personal productivity tools typically address one planning horizon. Bearing connects all three through a linking mechanism: theme colors propagate across views, and links enable navigation between related items (themes → objectives → key results → calendar days → tasks).

## Success Criteria
- Seamless navigation between planning layers via theme links
- All data persisted locally with git versioning for history/undo
- Desktop-native experience via Wails with Svelte 5 frontend

## Target Users
- Individual users who practice OKR-based personal planning
- People who want a unified view across strategic goals, daily focus, and task execution
