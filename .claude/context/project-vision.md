# Project Vision

## Long-term Direction
Bearing aims to be a complete personal planning system that seamlessly connects strategic life goals with daily execution, all running locally without cloud dependencies.

## Strategic Priorities
1. **Link integrity** — The core value is the linking mechanism between planning layers. All features should strengthen the theme → objective → calendar chain → task.
2. **Local-first** — Data stays on the user's machine with git versioning for history, branching, and recovery.
3. **Desktop-native** — Leverage Wails for a fast, native desktop experience rather than an Electron-style web wrapper.
4. **Developer-friendly** — Three dev environments (native, Wails proxy, Vite mock) enable rapid iteration on different aspects.

## Potential Future Expansions
- Data sync across devices (via git remotes)
- Review/retrospective views for OKR progress
- Recurring task support
- Dashboard/summary views
