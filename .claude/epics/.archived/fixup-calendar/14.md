# Task: Verify no regression in Wails mode

## Description

Verify that the fix doesn't break the application when running in Wails mode (`make dev`). The mock bindings should NOT initialize when real Wails bindings are present.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] App launches successfully with `make dev`
- [ ] Calendar view loads with real backend data
- [ ] OKR view works correctly
- [ ] EisenKan view works correctly
- [ ] No "Running in browser mode" console message appears
- [ ] Data persists correctly (changes saved to ~/.bearing/data/)

## Technical Details

### Test Steps
1. Run `make dev`
2. Verify Wails app window opens
3. Navigate to Calendar view - should load
4. Navigate to OKR view - should work
5. Navigate to Tasks view - should work
6. Create a theme and verify it persists
7. Check console for any errors

### Key Verification
The `isWailsRuntime()` check should return `true` in Wails mode, preventing mock initialization:
```typescript
if (!isWailsRuntime()) {
  // This should NOT execute in Wails mode
  initMockBindings();
}
```

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001 must be completed first

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: true (can run alongside Task 002)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Wails app launches without errors
- [ ] All three views work correctly
- [ ] Data operations persist to disk
- [ ] No mock-related console messages
