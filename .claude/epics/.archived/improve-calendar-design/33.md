# Task: Verify integration and run tests

## Description

Run all test suites and manually verify the complete calendar redesign works end-to-end. Ensure year navigation, today button, theme legend, and cross-view navigation all function correctly with the new layout.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `make test` passes (Go backend tests — DayFocus serialization with `text` field)
- [ ] `make test-frontend` passes (TypeScript type checking — no type errors)
- [ ] Year navigation: clicking < and > changes year, grid re-renders with correct weekday alignment
- [ ] Today button: scrolls/jumps to current year and highlights today's cell
- [ ] Theme legend: displays below grid, clicking a theme navigates to OKRView
- [ ] Cross-view navigation: clicking theme legend triggers `onNavigateToTheme`
- [ ] Edit dialog: opens on cell click, saves text + theme, clears correctly
- [ ] Weekday alignment spot-check: verify known dates (Jan 1 2026 = Thu, Feb 1 = Sun, Jul 1 = Wed)
- [ ] Sunday styling: only Sunday rows have distinct background
- [ ] Text overflow: long text is cropped with ellipsis, cell does not resize

## Technical Details

**Test commands:**
```bash
make test            # Go unit tests
make test-frontend   # TypeScript type checking
```

**Manual verification in browser mode:**
```bash
make frontend-dev    # Starts Vite dev server with mock bindings at localhost:5173
```
