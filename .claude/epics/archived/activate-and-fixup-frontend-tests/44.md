# Task: Add foundation component smoke tests

## Description
Add at least one smoke test for each reusable Svelte component (`Breadcrumb`, `ThemeBadge`, `ThemedContainer`) using `@testing-library/svelte`. These verify that Svelte 5 runes mode works in the Vitest jsdom environment and that components render without errors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `frontend/src/lib/components/Breadcrumb.test.ts` created with at least 1 test (renders with breadcrumb items)
- [ ] `frontend/src/lib/components/ThemeBadge.test.ts` created with at least 1 test (renders with theme color and abbreviation)
- [ ] `frontend/src/lib/components/ThemedContainer.test.ts` created with at least 1 test (renders with slot content)
- [ ] All tests use `@testing-library/svelte` `render()` function
- [ ] All tests pass with `npx vitest --run`
- [ ] Tests verify Svelte 5 `$props()` rune works in test environment
- [ ] If `@testing-library/svelte` doesn't work with Svelte 5 runes, document the issue and use direct Svelte `mount()` as fallback

## Technical Details
- Reference: `tmp/eisenkan/frontend/src/lib/components/ErrorDialog.test.ts` for patterns
- Read each component source first to understand its props interface
- Components: `frontend/src/lib/components/Breadcrumb.svelte`, `ThemeBadge.svelte`, `ThemedContainer.svelte`
- Use `render(Component, { props: {...} })` pattern
- Use `tick()` from `svelte` after render if needed for reactivity
- Components may depend on Wails mock bindings — if so, ensure mocks are set up in test or use `vitest.setup.ts`
- Keep tests minimal: verify the component mounts and renders expected DOM elements
- Use `container.querySelector()` for DOM assertions (as in EisenKan pattern)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 43 (Vitest and @testing-library/svelte must be installed)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: true (can run alongside Task 47)
