# Task: Add Makefile targets and gitignore entries

## Description
Add new `make` targets for running frontend unit tests and E2E tests, and add test artifact entries to `.gitignore`. Follow the EisenKan reference at `tmp/eisenkan/Makefile`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `make test-ui-unit` target added: runs `cd frontend && npm run check` then `cd frontend && npm test -- --run`
- [ ] `make test-ui-component-install` target added: runs `cd tests/ui-component && npm install && npx playwright install chromium`
- [ ] `make test-ui-component` target added: runs Playwright tests with note about requiring `frontend-dev`
- [ ] `make test-ui-component-headless` target added: runs with `HEADLESS=true`
- [ ] Existing `test-frontend` target updated to call `test-ui-unit` logic (replacing TypeScript-check-only behavior)
- [ ] `setup` target updated to include `test-ui-component-install`
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated with: `frontend/coverage/`, `tests/ui-component/node_modules/`, `tests/ui-component/test-results/`, `tests/ui-component/playwright-report/`
- [ ] `make help` shows all new targets with descriptions
- [ ] All existing make targets still work

## Technical Details
- Reference: `tmp/eisenkan/Makefile` lines 147-195 for the exact target patterns
- New targets go under the existing `##@ Testing` section in the Makefile
- Bearing uses `npm` (not `pnpm`), so use `npm run check` and `npm test` in targets
- E2E tests point to `localhost:5173` (Bearing's frontend-dev port), not 5174 like EisenKan
- The `test-ui-component` target should echo a note: "Ensure 'make frontend-dev' is running in another terminal first"

## Dependencies
- [ ] None — this is a foundation task (targets will fail until deps are installed, which is expected)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: true
