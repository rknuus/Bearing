# Task: End-to-end verification and fixups

## Description
Run all make targets end-to-end and fix any remaining issues. Verify that the complete test infrastructure works, no regressions exist in the native app or browser mock environment, and test artifacts are properly gitignored.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `make test-ui-unit` passes (id-parser tests + component smoke tests)
- [ ] `make test-ui-component` passes with `make frontend-dev` running
- [ ] `make test-ui-component-headless` passes in headless mode
- [ ] `make frontend-lint` still passes (no lint errors in new test files)
- [ ] `make frontend-check` still passes (no TypeScript errors)
- [ ] `make frontend-build` still passes (test files don't break the production build)
- [ ] `make frontend-dev` still works (browser mock environment unbroken)
- [ ] `git status` does not show test artifacts (coverage, node_modules, playwright-report)
- [ ] Total unit test count is at least 10 passing test cases
- [ ] At least 1 E2E test passes

## Technical Details
- This is an integration verification task — run every relevant `make` target and fix whatever breaks
- Common issues to watch for:
  - ESLint errors in new `.test.ts` files (may need to adjust lint config to handle test globals)
  - TypeScript errors from Vitest types (may need `/// <reference types="vitest" />` or tsconfig adjustment)
  - Wails-generated model imports not resolving in jsdom
  - `@testing-library/svelte` compatibility issues with Svelte 5 runes
- Fix any issues found; do not leave known failures
- If an issue cannot be resolved, document it clearly as a known limitation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 47 (migrated id-parser tests)
- [ ] Task 44 (component smoke tests)
- [ ] Task 48 (E2E smoke test)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: false (final integration task)
