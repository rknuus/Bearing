# Task: End-to-end verification and fixups

## Description

Run all make targets end-to-end and fix any remaining issues. Verify backward compatibility with existing KRs, test the full progress tracking flow (binary toggle, numeric update, over-achievement display), and ensure no regressions in either environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `make test` passes (all Go unit and integration tests)
- [ ] `make frontend-lint` passes
- [ ] `make frontend-check` passes
- [ ] `make frontend-build` passes
- [ ] `make frontend-dev` works — mock environment shows KRs with various progress states
- [ ] Existing KRs without progress data display unchanged (backward compatibility)
- [ ] Binary KR checkbox toggles correctly and persists
- [ ] Numeric KR progress bar displays "current / target" correctly
- [ ] Over-achievement (current > target) shows distinct styling
- [ ] KR edit form allows setting startValue and targetValue
- [ ] Quick progress update (checkbox / number input) works without opening full edit form
- [ ] No uncaught exceptions or infinite loops in native app variant

## Technical Details

- Run every relevant `make` target and fix whatever breaks
- Common issues to watch for:
  - New fields not properly passed through Wails binding conversion functions
  - TypeScript type mismatches in OKRView
  - Mock data inconsistencies
  - ESLint warnings on new template code
  - `$effect` reactive loops if progress update triggers unnecessary re-renders

## Dependencies

- [ ] #52 (backend model + method)
- [ ] #53 (frontend rendering + mock bindings)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 1-2
- Parallel: false
