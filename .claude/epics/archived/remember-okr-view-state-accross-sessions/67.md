# Task: Add expandedOkrIds to TypeScript NavigationContext interface

## Description
Add `expandedOkrIds?: string[]` to the `NavigationContext` interface in `frontend/src/lib/wails-mock.ts`. The mock bindings already serialize the full object to localStorage, so no further changes are needed — the field will be carried automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `NavigationContext` interface in `wails-mock.ts` includes `expandedOkrIds?: string[]`
- [ ] Mock `LoadNavigationContext` and `SaveNavigationContext` continue to work (they serialize/deserialize the full object, so the new field is included automatically)
- [ ] Frontend lint passes (`make frontend-lint`)
- [ ] Frontend type check passes (`make frontend-check`)

## Technical Details
- File: `frontend/src/lib/wails-mock.ts` (~line 57-65)
- Add `expandedOkrIds?: string[]` to the interface (optional field for backward compat)
- No changes needed to mock function implementations — they already use spread/JSON.parse on the full object

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task #66 (Go struct must exist first so Wails-generated bindings match, though the mock is independent)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.1
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Lint and type check pass
