# Task: Relocate PM data from .claude/ to .pm/

## Description
Move epic and PRD data files from `.claude/epics/` and `.claude/prds/` to `.pm/epics/` and `.pm/prds/`. Update all hardcoded path references in CCPM commands, scripts, and rules. This separates PM data from the `.claude/` settings directory to avoid permission prompts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `.pm/epics/` contains all epics (active + archived)
- [ ] `.pm/prds/` contains all PRD files
- [ ] Old `.claude/epics/` and `.claude/prds/` directories removed
- [ ] All path references updated in `.claude/ccpm/commands/pm/` (~19 files)
- [ ] All path references updated in `.claude/commands/pm/` (~19 files)
- [ ] All path references updated in `.claude/ccpm/scripts/pm/` (~12 files)
- [ ] All path references updated in `.claude/ccpm/rules/` (1 file)
- [ ] `grep -r '\.claude/epics/' .claude/ccpm/ .claude/commands/` returns zero matches
- [ ] `grep -r '\.claude/prds/' .claude/ccpm/ .claude/commands/` returns zero matches

## Technical Details

**Step 1: Move files**
```bash
mkdir -p .pm
mv .claude/epics .pm/epics
mv .claude/prds .pm/prds
```

**Step 2: Global path replacement**

Use `sed` or similar to replace in all affected files:
- `.claude/epics/` → `.pm/epics/`
- `.claude/prds/` → `.pm/prds/`

Directories to process:
- `.claude/ccpm/commands/pm/*.md` (~100 references across 19 files)
- `.claude/commands/pm/*.md` (~99 references across 19 files)
- `.claude/ccpm/scripts/pm/*.sh` (~52 references across 12 files)
- `.claude/ccpm/rules/agent-coordination.md` (1 reference)

**Step 3: Verify**
- Grep for any remaining `.claude/epics/` or `.claude/prds/` references
- Ensure no references to `.claude/prds` or `.claude/epics` without trailing slash are missed

**Note:** The `.claude/ccpm/epics/.gitkeep` and `.claude/ccpm/prds/.gitkeep` are part of the CCPM framework scaffold (empty placeholders). They do NOT need to move — they're not used by Bearing.

## Dependencies
- [ ] None — but should be done before task 004 verification

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Parallel: false (touches many files, should not conflict with other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Files moved
- [ ] All references updated
- [ ] Zero stale path references remain
