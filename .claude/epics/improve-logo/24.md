# Refine base logo SVG

## Description

Update `logo.svg` with the three core refinements: angle the compass needle ~8° clockwise, add N/E/S/W cardinal direction labels, and apply stronger/more vibrant colors. This produces the base variant (without zig-zag pattern).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Compass needle is rotated ~8° clockwise around the center point (100,100)
- [ ] N, E, S, W text labels are placed at the corresponding cardinal positions on the outer ring
- [ ] Labels use a clean sans-serif font and are proportional to the ring size
- [ ] North needle uses a vivid blue gradient (e.g., `#1e40af` → `#60a5fa`)
- [ ] South needle uses a warm red/coral tone (e.g., `#dc2626` or `#ef4444`) instead of slate gray
- [ ] Ring strokes are more visible (increased opacity and/or stroke width)
- [ ] SVG renders correctly in browser and macOS Preview
- [ ] Logo is recognizable at 64x64 pixels

## Technical Details

- **File**: `logo.svg` (replace existing)
- Wrap needle polygons in `<g transform="rotate(8, 100, 100)">...</g>`
- Add `<text>` elements: N at ~(100, 12), E at ~(190, 104), S at ~(100, 196), W at ~(14, 104)
- Use `font-family="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"`, `text-anchor="middle"`, `dominant-baseline="central"`
- Update gradient stops for north needle: `#1e40af` → `#60a5fa`
- Change south needle fill from `#94a3b8` to `#ef4444`
- Increase ring opacity (0.3→0.5, 0.5→0.7, 0.7→0.9) or increase stroke widths

## Dependencies

- None

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: true (can run alongside task #25)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SVG updated with all three refinements
- [ ] Renders correctly in browser
- [ ] Visually distinct and vibrant compared to the original draft
