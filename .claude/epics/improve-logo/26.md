# Generate appicon.png from selected variant

## Description

After the user selects their preferred variant (base or zig-zag), convert the chosen SVG to a 1024x1024 PNG and place it at `build/appicon.png` for the Wails desktop app icon. Also rename the selected variant to `logo.svg` if it's the zig-zag version.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User has reviewed both variants and selected one
- [ ] Selected SVG is saved as `logo.svg`
- [ ] `build/appicon.png` is 1024x1024 RGBA PNG
- [ ] PNG renders the logo correctly (no clipping, proper anti-aliasing)
- [ ] Unused variant file (`logo-zigzag.svg`) is cleaned up or kept as reference per user preference

## Technical Details

- **Files**: `logo.svg`, `build/appicon.png`
- Check for `rsvg-convert`: `which rsvg-convert` (from librsvg, installable via `brew install librsvg`)
- If available: `rsvg-convert -w 1024 -h 1024 logo.svg -o build/appicon.png`
- If not: try `npx @nicolo-ribaudo/svg2png-cli --width 1024 --height 1024 logo.svg -o build/appicon.png`
- Verify output: `file build/appicon.png` should show "PNG image data, 1024 x 1024"
- Ensure `build/bin/` directory exists before writing

## Dependencies

- Tasks #24 and #25 must be complete (user needs both variants to compare)
- SVG→PNG conversion tool (`rsvg-convert` preferred)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25
- Parallel: false (depends on user selection)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User has selected preferred variant
- [ ] `build/appicon.png` generated at 1024x1024
- [ ] Logo looks correct as rendered PNG
