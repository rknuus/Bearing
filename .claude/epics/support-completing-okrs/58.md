# Task: Add Status field to data models and OKR status constants

## Description
Add a `Status` string field to both `Objective` and `KeyResult` structs in the data model layer. Define an `OKRStatus` type with constants for the three valid states, plus a validation helper. Use `json:"status,omitempty"` so that the zero-value empty string means "active" and existing data files without the field load correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `Objective` struct has `Status string` field with `json:"status,omitempty"`
- [ ] `KeyResult` struct has `Status string` field with `json:"status,omitempty"`
- [ ] `OKRStatus` type defined as `string`
- [ ] Constants: `OKRStatusActive = "active"`, `OKRStatusCompleted = "completed"`, `OKRStatusArchived = "archived"`
- [ ] `IsValidOKRStatus(status string) bool` helper function (treats empty string as valid/active)
- [ ] Existing test suite passes without modification (backward compat)

## Technical Details
- File: `internal/access/models.go`
- Follow the existing pattern used by `TaskStatus` type and `IsValidTaskStatus()` in the same file
- The empty string `""` should be treated as equivalent to `"active"` in validation

## Dependencies
- [ ] None (first task in the chain)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Parallel: false (foundation for all other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Existing tests pass
- [ ] Linter passes
