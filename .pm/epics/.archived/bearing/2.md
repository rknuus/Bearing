# Task: Project Setup

## Description
Initialize a fresh Go/Wails/Svelte 5 project for Bearing. Set up the project structure, build configuration, and development environment. This is the foundation task that all other work depends on.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Wails v2 project initialized with Go backend
- [ ] Svelte 5 frontend configured with runes support
- [ ] Project builds and runs (shows empty window)
- [ ] Hot reload works for frontend development
- [ ] Browser-based testing mode works (mock Wails bindings)
- [ ] Basic directory structure matches architecture (cmd/, internal/, frontend/)

## Technical Details
- Use `wails init` with Svelte template, then upgrade to Svelte 5
- Configure Vite for Svelte 5 runes
- Set up TypeScript for frontend
- Create placeholder App.svelte with navigation shell structure
- Reference EisenKan's project structure for patterns
