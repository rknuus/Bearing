# Create zig-zag compass rose variant

## Description

Create a second SVG variant (`logo-zigzag.svg`) that includes all the base refinements from task #24 plus a traditional compass rose zig-zag star pattern between the outer and middle rings. This gives the user a choice between the clean and the ornamental version.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Contains all refinements from task #24 (angled needle, labels, strong colors)
- [ ] Adds a compass rose zig-zag (star) pattern between the outer and middle rings
- [ ] Zig-zag uses alternating light/dark triangular segments (8 or 16 points)
- [ ] Pattern is decorative but doesn't overwhelm the needle or labels
- [ ] SVG renders correctly in browser and macOS Preview
- [ ] Saved as `logo-zigzag.svg` (separate file for comparison)

## Technical Details

- **File**: `logo-zigzag.svg` (new file)
- Start from the refined base logo (same changes as task #24)
- Add a `<polygon>` or series of `<path>` elements forming a star/rose pattern
- Place between outer ring (r=85) and middle ring (r=62), so pattern fits in the ~23px band
- Use alternating fills: darker tone for major points (N/S/E/W), lighter for intercardinal
- Keep the pattern behind the needle layer (render order matters)

## Dependencies

- Conceptually depends on task #24 design decisions (colors, layout), but can be authored in parallel since both start from the same base

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: true (can run alongside task #24)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `logo-zigzag.svg` created with compass rose pattern
- [ ] Renders correctly in browser
- [ ] User can visually compare both variants side by side
