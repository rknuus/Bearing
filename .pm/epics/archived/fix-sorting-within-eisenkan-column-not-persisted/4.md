# Task: Wails bindings — ReorderTasks binding + update MoveTask return type

## Description
Add `ReorderTasks` Wails binding in `main.go` that delegates to `PlanningManager.ReorderTasks`. Update the `MoveTask` binding and its frontend return type to include the `Positions` field from the updated `MoveTaskResult`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New `ReorderTasks(positions map[string][]string) (*ReorderResult, error)` method on `App` in `main.go`
- [ ] `ReorderTasks` delegates to `app.planningManager.ReorderTasks(positions)` and converts types as needed
- [ ] Frontend `MoveTaskResult` type updated to include `Positions: Record<string, string[]>`
- [ ] Frontend `ReorderResult` type added: `{ Success: boolean; Positions: Record<string, string[]> }`
- [ ] Wails binding generation produces correct TypeScript types
- [ ] Run `make generate` (or equivalent) to regenerate Wails bindings

## Technical Details
- Follow the existing pattern in `main.go` for binding methods (see `MoveTask`, `GetTasks`, etc.)
- The `ReorderResult` Go type is defined in the manager layer (task 3) — `main.go` may need its own binding-friendly type or can use the manager type directly if it's exported
- After adding the binding, run Wails binding generation so frontend TypeScript types are updated
- The `MoveTaskResult` in `main.go` (line ~618) needs the `Positions` field added

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3: Manager layer ReorderTasks + MoveTaskResult update

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Parallel: false (depends on task 3, needed by task 5)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Wails bindings generated
- [ ] Linting passes
