# Task: Verify lint, type-check, tests, and cross-environment rendering

## Description

Run all validation checks after the card styling changes. Ensure no lint errors, type errors, or test failures. Confirm the updated cards render correctly in both the Vite mock-binding environment and the native Wails application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `make frontend-lint` passes with no errors
- [ ] `make frontend-check` passes with no type errors
- [ ] `make frontend-test` passes (if frontend tests exist)
- [ ] `make test` passes (Go backend tests)
- [ ] Cards render correctly in Vite dev (localhost:5173) with mock bindings
- [ ] Cards render correctly in native Wails app (localhost:34115 or built app)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop between quadrants works in both environments

## Technical Details

- Run lint/check/test commands via Makefile
- Visual verification in both dev environments
- Test drag-and-drop: create a task, drag it between quadrants, confirm it moves correctly

**Files affected:** None (verification only)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001 completed

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All make commands pass
- [ ] Visual verification in both environments
