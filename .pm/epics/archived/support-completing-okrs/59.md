# Task: Update frontend TypeScript interfaces and mock bindings

## Description
Add `status?: string` to the TypeScript `Objective` and `KeyResult` interfaces in both `OKRView.svelte` and `wails-mock.ts`. Implement `SetObjectiveStatus` and `SetKeyResultStatus` mock functions in `wails-mock.ts` with the same validation logic as the backend. Add `showCompleted` and `showArchived` to the `NavigationContext` interface and mock storage. Update mock data to include some completed/archived items for testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `status?: string` added to `Objective` and `KeyResult` interfaces in `OKRView.svelte`
- [ ] `status?: string` added to `Objective` and `KeyResult` interfaces in `wails-mock.ts`
- [ ] `SetObjectiveStatus(objectiveId: string, status: string)` mock implementation with transition validation
- [ ] `SetKeyResultStatus(keyResultId: string, status: string)` mock implementation with transition validation
- [ ] Mock validates: active→completed (with children check for objectives), completed→archived, completed/archived→active
- [ ] Mock blocks: active→archived
- [ ] `showCompleted` and `showArchived` fields added to `NavigationContext` interface and mock storage
- [ ] Mock data includes at least one completed KR and one completed Objective for visual testing
- [ ] `WailsGoBindings` type updated to include the new methods

## Technical Details
- Files: `frontend/src/views/OKRView.svelte` (interfaces only), `frontend/src/lib/wails-mock.ts`
- Use existing `findObjectiveById`, `findKeyResultParent` helpers in wails-mock.ts
- For parent completion check in mock: iterate objective's children and keyResults, check status field

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 062 (Wails binding signatures must be finalized)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Parallel: false (depends on 062)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Frontend linter passes (`make frontend-lint`)
- [ ] Type checks pass (`make frontend-check`)
