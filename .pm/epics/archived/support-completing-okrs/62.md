# Task: Add Wails binding methods and update type converters

## Description
Expose the new `SetObjectiveStatus` and `SetKeyResultStatus` methods to the frontend via Wails bindings in `main.go`. Update the Wails binding structs (`Objective`, `KeyResult`) and the `convertObjective`/`convertObjectiveToAccess` helper functions to include the `Status` field.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `Status string` field added to Wails `Objective` struct in `main.go` with `json:"status,omitempty"`
- [ ] `Status string` field added to Wails `KeyResult` struct in `main.go` with `json:"status,omitempty"`
- [ ] `convertObjective` maps `Status` from access.Objective to Wails Objective (and recursively for children/KRs)
- [ ] `convertObjectiveToAccess` maps `Status` from Wails Objective to access.Objective
- [ ] `SetObjectiveStatus(objectiveId, status string) error` Wails binding method on App
- [ ] `SetKeyResultStatus(keyResultId, status string) error` Wails binding method on App
- [ ] Both methods delegate to `planningManager` with nil guard

## Technical Details
- File: `main.go`
- Follow existing patterns for binding methods (nil check on planningManager, delegate to manager)
- Status field mapping in converters follows same pattern as other fields (direct assignment)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 060 (manager methods must exist)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Parallel: false (depends on 060)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] App compiles successfully
- [ ] Linter passes
