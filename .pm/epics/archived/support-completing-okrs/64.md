# Task: Extend NavigationContext with ShowCompleted and ShowArchived fields

## Description
Add `ShowCompleted` and `ShowArchived` boolean fields to the `NavigationContext` struct in all three layers (access models, managers, and Wails bindings in main.go) to persist the OKR view toggle states across sessions. Both default to false (hide completed/archived by default).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `ShowCompleted bool` and `ShowArchived bool` added to `access.NavigationContext` with `json:"showCompleted,omitempty"` and `json:"showArchived,omitempty"`
- [ ] Same fields added to `managers.NavigationContext`
- [ ] Same fields added to Wails `NavigationContext` in `main.go`
- [ ] `LoadNavigationContext` and `SaveNavigationContext` in both managers and main.go pass these fields through
- [ ] Existing navigation context files without these fields load correctly (zero-value = false)

## Technical Details
- Files: `internal/access/models.go`, `internal/managers/planning_manager.go`, `main.go`
- Use `json:"...,omitempty"` so existing JSON files without these fields are backward compatible
- Follow existing field patterns in NavigationContext

## Dependencies
- [ ] None (independent of Status field tasks)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Parallel: true (can run alongside tasks 058-062)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Existing tests pass
- [ ] Linter passes
