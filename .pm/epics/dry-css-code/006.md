# Task: Migrate CalendarView to shared components

## Description
Refactor CalendarView.svelte to use the shared Dialog and Button components. Normalize its button border-radius (4px→6px) and dialog z-index (100→1000) to match the unified design.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CalendarView uses `<Dialog>` for its modal overlay + container
- [ ] CalendarView uses `<Button>` for primary and secondary buttons
- [ ] Duplicated CSS for `.dialog-overlay`, `.dialog`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary` removed
- [ ] Button border-radius normalized to 6px (via design tokens)
- [ ] Dialog z-index normalized to 1000
- [ ] Visual appearance unchanged (except minor border-radius normalization)
- [ ] Both Wails native and browser mock mode work correctly
- [ ] `make frontend-lint` and `make frontend-check` pass

## Technical Details
- File to modify: `frontend/src/views/CalendarView.svelte`
- CalendarView secondary button was `background: #e5e7eb` (gray) instead of white — normalize to match standard secondary variant or use a separate variant if intentional
- CalendarView form inputs have slightly different focus ring (2px vs 3px) — normalize via tokens
- Keep CalendarView-specific styles (calendar grid, day cells, event display)

## Dependencies
- Task 002 (Button.svelte)
- Task 003 (Dialog.svelte)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Parallel: true (can run alongside 005, 007)
