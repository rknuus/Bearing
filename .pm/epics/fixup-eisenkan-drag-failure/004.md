# Task: Lint, type-check, and validate all tests pass

## Description

Final validation gate: run all linting, type checking, and test suites to ensure no regressions were introduced by the drag-and-drop fixes and the promotions fix.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `make frontend-lint` passes with no errors
- [ ] `make frontend-check` (svelte-check) passes with no errors
- [ ] `make frontend-test` passes (all unit tests including new drag tests)
- [ ] `make test` passes (Go backend tests)
- [ ] E2E tests in `tests/ui-component/view-workflows.test.js` pass
- [ ] No `$effect` infinite loop warnings from `svelte/infinite-reactive-loop` ESLint rule

## Technical Details

### Commands to Run
1. `make frontend-lint`
2. `make frontend-check`
3. `make frontend-test`
4. `make test`

### Key Considerations
- Go tests in `internal/utilities` can be flaky (race conditions) — rerun once to confirm if failures occur
- Fix any lint issues introduced by new code before marking complete
- Verify no new TypeScript errors from section-level item state changes

## Dependencies

- [ ] All previous tasks (001, 002, 003) must be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Parallel: false (final validation)
