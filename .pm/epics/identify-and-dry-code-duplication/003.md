# Task: Final verification — full test suite and lint

## Description
Run the complete test suite and all linters from the project root to verify that both the Go backend and frontend refactoring work correctly together with no regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `make test` passes (all Go + frontend tests)
- [ ] `make lint` passes (Go + frontend linters)
- [ ] No duplicated `getBindings()` definitions remain in Svelte components
- [ ] No duplicated `getTheme`/`getThemeColor` definitions remain in Svelte components
- [ ] No duplicated `priorityLabels` definitions remain in Svelte components
- [ ] No duplicated git transaction boilerplate remains in `plan_access.go`
- [ ] No duplicated task-finding loops remain in `plan_access.go`
- [ ] No duplicated JSON marshal+write blocks remain in `plan_access.go`

## Technical Details
- Run `make test` from project root (lint + Go tests + frontend check + Vitest)
- Run `make lint` from project root (Go linter + ESLint)
- Grep for remaining duplication patterns to confirm elimination

## Dependencies
- [ ] 001 — Extract Go backend helpers
- [ ] 002 — Extract frontend shared utilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: false
