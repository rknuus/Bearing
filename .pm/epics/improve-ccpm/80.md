# Task: Verify all PM commands work after changes

## Description
Run verification checks to confirm all CCPM commands work correctly after the `--json` fix and data relocation. Ensure no stale path references remain and all scripts find files in the new `.pm/` directory.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `grep -r '\.pm/epics/' .claude/ccpm/ .claude/commands/` returns zero matches
- [ ] `grep -r '\.pm/prds/' .claude/ccpm/ .claude/commands/` returns zero matches
- [ ] `grep -r '\-\-json number' .claude/ccpm/ .claude/commands/ tmp/ccpm/` returns zero matches
- [ ] `make test` passes (no regressions)
- [ ] `.pm/epics/` and `.pm/prds/` contain all expected files

## Technical Details

**Verification steps:**
1. Run grep checks for stale path references
2. Run grep check for `--json number` remnants
3. Verify file counts: `.pm/prds/` should have all PRD files, `.pm/epics/` should have all epic directories
4. Run `make test` to confirm no regressions
5. Verify `tmp/ccpm/` fork has clean feature branch with commits

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Fix gh issue create
- [ ] Task 002: Relocate PM data
- [ ] Task 003: Upstream fixes to fork

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Parallel: false (must run after all other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All verification checks pass
- [ ] No stale references found
- [ ] Tests pass
