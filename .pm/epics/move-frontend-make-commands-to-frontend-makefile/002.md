# Task: Verify all Make targets from both directories

## Description
Run every Make target from both the project root and `frontend/` directory to confirm identical behavior. Verify `make help` output, lint, check, test, and build targets all work correctly through the proxy delegation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `make help` from root shows all original targets with correct descriptions
- [ ] `make help` from `frontend/` shows frontend-specific targets
- [ ] `make frontend-lint` from root works (delegates to frontend)
- [ ] `make lint` from `frontend/` works directly
- [ ] `make frontend-check` from root works
- [ ] `make check` from `frontend/` works
- [ ] `make test-frontend` from root works (runs check + vitest)
- [ ] `make test` from `frontend/` works
- [ ] `make frontend-install` from root works
- [ ] `make install` from `frontend/` works
- [ ] `make lint` from root runs both Go and frontend linters
- [ ] `make test` from root runs both backend and frontend tests
- [ ] Exit codes propagate correctly (a failing lint from frontend/ returns non-zero)

## Technical Details
- Run targets sequentially, comparing output between root proxy and direct frontend invocation
- Verify `make -n` (dry-run) shows correct delegation for proxy targets
- Check that `make frontend-build` from root still runs lint first (dependency preserved)

## Dependencies
- [ ] 001 — Create frontend/Makefile and convert root targets to proxies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: false
