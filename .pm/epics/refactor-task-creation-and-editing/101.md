# Task: Lint, type-check, and verify all tests pass

## Description

Run all frontend quality checks to verify the refactoring introduces no regressions. Fix any lint errors, type errors, or test failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `make frontend-lint` passes with no errors
- [ ] `make frontend-check` passes with no type errors
- [ ] All frontend tests pass
- [ ] No visual regressions in either dialog when tested manually in browser (localhost:5173)

## Technical Details

- Run `make frontend-lint` — fix any ESLint issues in new/modified files
- Run `make frontend-check` — fix any svelte-check / TypeScript issues
- Run frontend tests — fix any broken selectors or assertions
- Verify in browser that CreateTaskDialog and EditTaskDialog render correctly

### Files affected
- Any files modified in tasks 001–003 that have lint/type issues

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Parallel: false (depends on all prior tasks)
