# Task: Simplify CreateTask priority validation in planning manager

## Description
Replace the hardcoded 3-priority allowlist in `CreateTask()` with a call to `access.IsValidPriority()`. Now that Q4 is removed from the model (issue #90), `IsValidPriority` covers exactly the right set.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `CreateTask()` in `planning_manager.go` uses `access.IsValidPriority(priority)` instead of the hardcoded slice
- [ ] Comment on `CreateTask()` updated (remove Q4 mention)
- [ ] `planning_manager_test.go` "rejects Q4 priority" test still passes (Q4 is now invalid via `IsValidPriority`)
- [ ] `make test` passes

## Technical Details
- Files affected:
  - `internal/managers/planning_manager.go` — replace lines 746-759 with `if !access.IsValidPriority(priority)` check
  - `internal/managers/planning_manager_test.go` — verify existing Q4 rejection test still works (may need minor wording update)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Issue #90 must be completed first (Q4 must be removed from `ValidPriorities()`)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Parallel: false (depends on #90)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests passing (`make test`)
