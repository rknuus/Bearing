# Task: Add optional fields UI to CreateTaskDialog

## Description
Extend the CreateTaskDialog to let users optionally fill in Description, Tags, DueDate, and PromotionDate per task entry, and customize the DayDate (currently hardcoded to today). The Eisenhower quadrant drag-and-drop workflow stays — optional fields are shown as a collapsible detail section per task entry.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DayDate picker at the top of the dialog, defaulting to today, shared across all tasks
- [ ] Each task entry in a quadrant has an expand/collapse toggle for optional fields
- [ ] Expanded state shows: Description (textarea), Tags (text input), DueDate (date input), PromotionDate (date input)
- [ ] Optional fields default to empty
- [ ] Quick entry still works: user can type title and press Enter without touching optional fields
- [ ] All filled fields are passed through to the `createTask` callback on submit
- [ ] `make test-frontend` passes
- [ ] `make frontend-lint` and `make frontend-check` pass
- [ ] Both browser dev mode (localhost:5173) and native app work correctly

## Technical Details
- Files affected:
  - `frontend/src/components/CreateTaskDialog.svelte` — add DayDate picker, per-task detail expansion
  - `frontend/src/components/EisenhowerQuadrant.svelte` — render optional fields when expanded, store them on PendingTask
  - `frontend/src/components/CreateTaskDialog.test.ts` — add tests for new fields
- UX consideration: keep the quadrant compact by default. A small icon/button per task entry toggles the detail fields. When collapsed, only the title is shown (current behavior).

## Dependencies
- [ ] Issue #95 must be completed first (types and callsites ready)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Parallel: false (depends on #95)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Lint and type checks passing
- [ ] Manual verification in both browser and native modes
