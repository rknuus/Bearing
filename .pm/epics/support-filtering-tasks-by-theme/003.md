# Task: Tests and final verification

## Description
Run full test suite and linters. Add tests for the new ThemeFilterBar component. Verify all acceptance criteria from the PRD including multi-select, persistence, smart default, and cross-view navigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `make test` passes (all Go + frontend tests)
- [ ] `make lint` passes (Go + frontend linters)
- [ ] New ThemeFilterBar component has unit tests covering: render pills, toggle active state, clear all, empty state
- [ ] Existing EisenKanView tests updated for `filterThemeIds` prop
- [ ] No `filterThemeId` (single string) references remain in frontend code (fully migrated to `filterThemeIds`)
- [ ] Verify filter persists in navigation_context.json after simulated save/load cycle
- [ ] Verify backward compat: old `filterThemeId` string in JSON is read correctly

## Technical Details
- New test file: `frontend/src/components/ThemeFilterBar.test.ts`
- Update existing test files that reference `filterThemeId` prop
- Run `make test` from project root for comprehensive verification
- Grep for remaining `filterThemeId` (single, non-plural) references to ensure full migration

## Dependencies
- [ ] 001 — Go NavigationContext struct
- [ ] 002 — Frontend implementation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1.5
- Parallel: false
