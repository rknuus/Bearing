> Think carefully and implement the most concise solution that changes as little code as possible.

## Project-Specific Instructions

- See [README](README.md) for background about the project.
- To run common development operations, use `make` commands. Do not come up with own commands. If a `make` command you need is missing, tell the user.
- Apply frontend changes to both the browser-based testing variant based on mock bindings and the native application variant based on Wails runtime.
- When changing frontend code, carefully avoid uncaught exceptions and infinite loops in the native application.

## Testing

Always run tests before committing.

## Code Style

Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
