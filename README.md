# Bearing

## About

Bearing is a personal planning system supporting interlinked long-, medium, and short-term planning.

### Three Planning Layers

1. **Long-term (OKR View)**: Life Themes with Objectives and Key Results
2. **Mid-term (Calendar View)**: Yearly 12×31 grid for daily focus assignment
3. **Short-term (EisenKan View)**: Kanban board with Eisenhower priority sorting

The core value is the **linking mechanism** - theme colors propagate through all layers, and hierarchical IDs enable navigation between related items.

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.21+
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Wails](https://wails.io/) v2 (`go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest`)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
make setup

# Run in development mode (opens native app with hot reload)
make dev
```

## Development

### Available Commands

Run `make help` to see all available commands:

```
Development:
  make setup              Setup project (install all dependencies)
  make dev                Run Wails app in development mode with hot reload
  make frontend-dev       Run Vite dev server only (for browser testing)
  make stop-dev           Stop any running dev servers

Build:
  make build              Build Wails desktop application
  make build-go           Build Go binary only (without frontend)
  make clean              Clean build artifacts

Testing:
  make test                       Run all tests (Go + frontend)
  make test-backend               Run all Go tests
  make test-backend-unit          Run Go unit tests only
  make test-backend-integration   Run Go integration tests
  make test-backend-performance   Run Go performance tests
  make test-backend-bench         Run Go benchmarks
  make test-frontend              Run frontend TypeScript checks and Vitest tests
  make test-frontend-e2e          Run Playwright E2E tests

Frontend:
  make frontend-install   Install frontend dependencies
  make frontend-build     Build frontend for production
  make frontend-check     Run TypeScript type checking
```

### Development Modes

**Full Application (Wails + Native Window)**
```bash
make dev
```
Opens a native desktop window with Vite hot module replacement enabled.

**Frontend Only (Browser Testing)**
```bash
make frontend-dev
```
Runs Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173 with mock Wails bindings. Useful for UI development without the native wrapper.

## Building

```bash
# Build production binary
make build
```

The built application will be in `build/bin/bearing`.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test categories
make test-backend-unit          # Go unit tests
make test-backend-integration   # Go integration tests
make test-backend-performance   # Go performance tests
make test-backend-bench         # Go benchmarks
make test-frontend              # Frontend type checks + Vitest
make test-frontend-e2e          # Playwright E2E tests
```

### Test Structure

## Data Storage

Data is stored in `~/.bearing/` as JSON files with git versioning:

```
~/.bearing/
├── themes/themes.json         # Life themes with OKRs
├── calendar/2026.json         # Day focus entries

## Development Notes

This application is developed using specification-driven multi-agent ML model support based on [CCPM](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm).
